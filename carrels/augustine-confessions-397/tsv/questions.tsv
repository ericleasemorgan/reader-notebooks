chapter-001	Grant me, Lord, to know and understand which is first, to call on Thee or to praise Thee?
chapter-001	Have I not confessed against myself my transgressions unto Thee, and Thou, my God, hast forgiven the iniquity of my heart?
chapter-001	I beseech Thee, my God, I would fain know, if so Thou willest, for what purpose my baptism was then deferred?
chapter-001	If not, why does it still echo in our ears on all sides,"Let him alone, let him do as he will, for he is not yet baptised?"
chapter-001	If, again, I should ask which might be forgotten with least detriment to the concerns of life, reading and writing or these poetic fictions?
chapter-001	In so small a creature, what was not wonderful, not admirable?
chapter-001	Is it then a slight woe to love Thee not?
chapter-001	Let him also rejoice and say, What thing is this?
chapter-001	Nor did that depart,--(for whither went it?)
chapter-001	Or was it then good, even for a while, to cry for what, if given, would hurt?
chapter-001	Or what am I to Thee that Thou demandest my love, and, if I give it not, art wroth with me, and threatenest me with grievous woes?
chapter-001	Or, is it rather, that we call on Thee that we may know Thee?
chapter-001	Say, Lord, to me, Thy suppliant; say, all- pitying, to me, Thy pitiable one; say, did my infancy succeed another age of mine that died before it?
chapter-001	Shall any be his own artificer?
chapter-001	Since, then, I too exist, why do I seek that Thou shouldest enter into me, who were not, wert Thou not in me?
chapter-001	Therefore I contend not in judgment with Thee; for if Thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall abide it?
chapter-001	Thou receivest over and above, that Thou mayest owe; and who hath aught that is not Thine?
chapter-001	What art Thou then, my God?
chapter-001	What art Thou to me?
chapter-001	What is it to me, O my true life, my God, that my declamation was applauded above so many of my own age and class?
chapter-001	What is it to me, though any comprehend not this?
chapter-001	What then was my sin?
chapter-001	Whence could such a being be, save from Thee, Lord?
chapter-001	Whither do I call Thee, since I am in Thee?
chapter-001	Who knows not this?
chapter-001	Who remindeth me of the sins of my infancy?
chapter-001	Who remindeth me?
chapter-001	Who shall stand against thee?
chapter-001	Why then did I hate the Greek classics, which have the like tales?
chapter-001	Why?
chapter-001	Wilt Thou hold Thy peace for ever?
chapter-001	and all at once the same part?
chapter-001	and was there nothing else whereon to exercise my wit and tongue?
chapter-001	and what before that life again, O God my joy, was I any where or any body?
chapter-001	and what else did he who beat me?
chapter-001	and what room is there within me, whither my God can come into me?
chapter-001	and, again, to know Thee or to call on Thee?
chapter-001	bitterly to resent, that persons free, and its own elders, yea, the very authors of its birth, served it not?
chapter-001	but how shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?
chapter-001	do then heaven and earth, which Thou hast made, and wherein Thou hast made me, contain Thee?
chapter-001	doth not each little infant, in whom I see what of myself I remember not?
chapter-001	for of that I have heard somewhat, and have myself seen women with child?
chapter-001	for who can call on Thee, not knowing Thee?
chapter-001	how long roll the sons of Eve into that huge and hideous ocean, which even they scarcely overpass who climb the cross?
chapter-001	how long shalt thou not be dried up?
chapter-001	is not all this smoke and wind?
chapter-001	is there, indeed, O Lord my God, aught in me that can contain Thee?
chapter-001	or can there elsewhere be derived any vein, which may stream essence and life into us, save from thee, O Lord, in whom essence and life are one?
chapter-001	or dost Thou fill them and yet overflow, since they do not contain Thee?
chapter-001	or each its own part, the greater more, the smaller less?
chapter-001	or hast Thou no need that aught contain Thee, who containest all things, since what Thou fillest Thou fillest by containing it?
chapter-001	or how shall they believe without a preacher?
chapter-001	or to whom should I cry, save Thee?
chapter-001	or was it not laid loose?
chapter-001	or what saith any man when he speaks of Thee?
chapter-001	or whence canst Thou enter into me?
chapter-001	or who is God save our God?
chapter-001	or, art Thou wholly every where, while nothing contains Thee wholly?
chapter-001	or, because nothing which exists could exist without Thee, doth therefore whatever exists contain Thee?
chapter-001	or, since all things can not contain Thee wholly, do they contain part of Thee?
chapter-001	that many besides, wiser than it, obeyed not the nod of its good pleasure?
chapter-001	that period I pass by; and what have I now to do with that, of which I can recall no vestige?
chapter-001	to do its best to strike and hurt, because commands were not obeyed, which had been obeyed to its hurt?
chapter-001	was it for my good that the rein was laid loose, as it were, upon me, for me to sin?
chapter-001	was it that I hung upon the breast and cried?
chapter-001	was it that which I spent within my mother''s womb?
chapter-001	what, but the Lord God?
chapter-001	whither can God come into me, God who made heaven and earth?
chapter-001	who does not foresee what all must answer who have not wholly forgotten themselves?
chapter-001	who, if worsted in some trifling discussion with his fellow- tutor, was more embittered and jealous than I when beaten at ball by a play- fellow?
chapter-011	And if any should ask me,"How knowest thou?"
chapter-011	And that very long one do I measure as present, seeing I measure it not till it be ended?
chapter-011	And whence should he be able to do this, unless Thou hadst made that mind?
chapter-011	And whence should they be, hadst not Thou appointed them?
chapter-011	And who denies past things to be now no longer?
chapter-011	And who denieth the present time hath no space, because it passeth away in a moment?
chapter-011	Are an hundred years, when present, a long time?
chapter-011	BOOK XI Lord, since eternity is Thine, art Thou ignorant of what I say to Thee?
chapter-011	But do I perceive it, or seem to perceive it?
chapter-011	But how didst Thou make the heaven and the earth?
chapter-011	But how didst Thou speak?
chapter-011	But how dost Thou make them?
chapter-011	But how is that future diminished or consumed, which as yet is not?
chapter-011	But if before heaven and earth there was no time, why is it demanded, what Thou then didst?
chapter-011	But if the will of God has been from eternity that the creature should be, why was not the creature also from eternity?"
chapter-011	But in what sense is that long or short, which is not?
chapter-011	But time present how do we measure, seeing it hath no space?
chapter-011	But we measure times as they are passing, by perceiving them; but past, which now are not, or the future, which are not yet, who can measure?
chapter-011	But what in discourse do we mention more familiarly and knowingly, than time?
chapter-011	But whence should I know, whether he spake truth?
chapter-011	But whence, by what way, and whither passes it while it is a measuring?
chapter-011	By what Word then didst Thou speak, that a body might be made, whereby these words again might be made?
chapter-011	By what way dost Thou, to whom nothing is to come, teach things to come; or rather of the future, dost teach things present?
chapter-011	Can my hand do this, or the hand of my mouth by speech bring about a thing so great?
chapter-011	Could it be measured the rather, for that?
chapter-011	Do I then measure, O my God, and know not what I measure?
chapter-011	Does not my soul most truly confess unto Thee, that I do measure times?
chapter-011	Dost Thou bid me assent, if any define time to be"motion of a body?"
chapter-011	For if He made, what did He make but a creature?
chapter-011	For if Thine ears be not with us in the depths also, whither shall we go?
chapter-011	For if( say they) He were unemployed and wrought not, why does He not also henceforth, and for ever, as He did heretofore?
chapter-011	For that past time which was long, was it long when it was now past, or when it was yet present?
chapter-011	For what is time?
chapter-011	For what is, but because Thou art?
chapter-011	For what, I beseech Thee, O my God, do I measure, when I say, either indefinitely"this is a longer time than that,"or definitely"this is double that"?
chapter-011	For when a body is moved, I by time measure, how long it moveth, from the time it began to move until it left off?
chapter-011	For whence could innumerable ages pass by, which Thou madest not, Thou the Author and Creator of all ages?
chapter-011	For whence shouldest Thou have this, which Thou hadst not made, thereof to make any thing?
chapter-011	For where did they, who foretold things to come, see them, if as yet they be not?
chapter-011	For why should not the motions of all bodies rather be times?
chapter-011	How may it then be measured?
chapter-011	How then know I this, seeing I know not what time is?
chapter-011	I measure the motion of a body in time; and the time itself do I not measure?
chapter-011	In the future, whence it passeth through?
chapter-011	In the way that the voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son?
chapter-011	In what space then do we measure time passing?
chapter-011	Is it to come?
chapter-011	Lo, are they not full of their old leaven, who say to us,"What was God doing before He made heaven and earth?
chapter-011	O my Lord, my Light, shall not here also Thy Truth mock at man?
chapter-011	Or in the present, by which it passes?
chapter-011	Or, should there in our words be some syllables short, others long, but because those sounded in a shorter time, these in a longer?
chapter-011	Or, while we were saying this, should we not also be speaking in time?
chapter-011	Or,"How came it into His mind to make any thing, having never before made any thing?"
chapter-011	See, I answer him that asketh,"What did God before He made heaven and earth?"
chapter-011	Seeing then Thou art the Creator of all times, if any time was before Thou madest heaven and earth, why say they that Thou didst forego working?
chapter-011	This same time then, how do I measure?
chapter-011	This then that He is said"never to have made"; what else is it to say, than"in''no time''to have made?"
chapter-011	Those two times then, past and to come, how are they, seeing the past now is not, and that to come is not yet?
chapter-011	Thou then, Ruler of Thy creation, by what way dost Thou teach souls things to come?
chapter-011	Times passing, not past?
chapter-011	What is that which gleams through me, and strikes my heart without hurting it; and I shudder and kindle?
chapter-011	What then do I measure?
chapter-011	What then is it I measure?
chapter-011	What then is time?
chapter-011	What when we measure silence, and say that this silence hath held as long time as did that voice?
chapter-011	What wilt thou answer me?
chapter-011	When therefore will it be?
chapter-011	Whence it seemed to me, that time is nothing else than protraction; but of what, I know not; and I marvel, if it be not of the mind itself?
chapter-011	Where then is the time, which we may call long?
chapter-011	Which way, but through the present?
chapter-011	Who can even in thought comprehend it, so as to utter a word about it?
chapter-011	Who can readily and briefly explain this?
chapter-011	Who declare it?
chapter-011	Who now teacheth us, but the unchangeable Truth?
chapter-011	Who shall comprehend?
chapter-011	Who therefore denieth, that things to come are not as yet?
chapter-011	Whom shall I enquire of concerning these things?
chapter-011	Why then do I lay in order before Thee so many relations?
chapter-011	Why, I beseech Thee, O Lord my God?
chapter-011	Yea, and if I knew this also, should I know it from him?
chapter-011	Yet what do we measure, if not time in some space?
chapter-011	and what the engine of Thy so mighty fabric?
chapter-011	but no space, we do not measure: or in the past, to which it passes?
chapter-011	do we by a shorter time measure a longer, as by the space of a cubit, the space of a rood?
chapter-011	how, O God, didst Thou make heaven and earth?
chapter-011	or dost Thou see in time, what passeth in time?
chapter-011	or how should they pass by, if they never were?
chapter-011	or how that past increased, which is now no longer, save that in the mind which enacteth this, there be three things done?
chapter-011	or is it perchance that I know not how to express what I know?
chapter-011	or what times should there be, which were not made by Thee?
chapter-011	whence, but from the future?
chapter-011	where is the short syllable by which I measure?
chapter-011	where the long which I measure?
chapter-011	whither cry?
chapter-011	whither, but into the past?
chapter-010	"Is that it?"
chapter-010	Am I not then myself, O Lord my God?
chapter-010	Am I then doubtful of myself in this matter?
chapter-010	And I turned myself unto myself, and said to myself,"Who art thou?"
chapter-010	And from Thee, O Lord, unto whose eyes the abyss of man''s conscience is naked, what could be hidden in me though I would not confess it?
chapter-010	And how shall I find Thee, if I remember Thee not?
chapter-010	And what is this?
chapter-010	And whence does that present itself, but out of the memory itself?
chapter-010	And whence is it that often even in sleep we resist, and mindful of our purpose, and abiding most chastely in it, yield no assent to such enticements?
chapter-010	And where do I recognise it, but in the memory itself?
chapter-010	And where shall I find Thee?
chapter-010	And where should that be, which it containeth not of itself?
chapter-010	And who is he, O Lord, who is not some whit transported beyond the limits of necessity?
chapter-010	And why seek I now in what place thereof Thou dwellest, as if there were places therein?
chapter-010	As then we remember joy?
chapter-010	As we remember eloquence then?
chapter-010	As we remember numbers then?
chapter-010	But for what fruit would they hear this?
chapter-010	But is it so, as one remembers Carthage who hath seen it?
chapter-010	But now when I hear that there be three kinds of questions,"Whether the thing be?
chapter-010	But what do I love, when I love Thee?
chapter-010	But what is forgetfulness, but the privation of memory?
chapter-010	But what is nearer to me than myself?
chapter-010	But what when the memory itself loses any thing, as falls out when we forget and seek that we may recollect?
chapter-010	But when it was present, how did it write its image in the memory, seeing that forgetfulness by its presence effaces even what it finds already noted?
chapter-010	But where in my memory residest Thou, O Lord, where residest Thou there?
chapter-010	But whether by images or no, who can readily say?
chapter-010	But why doth"truth generate hatred,"and the man of Thine, preaching the truth, become an enemy to them?
chapter-010	By remembrance, as though I had forgotten it, remembering that I had forgotten it?
chapter-010	By which of these ought I to seek my God?
chapter-010	Do they desire to joy with me, when they hear how near, by Thy gift, I approach unto Thee?
chapter-010	Does the memory perchance not belong to the mind?
chapter-010	For I ask any one, had he rather joy in truth, or in falsehood?
chapter-010	For then I ask myself how much more or less troublesome it is to me not to have them?
chapter-010	For what is it to hear from Thee of themselves, but to know themselves?
chapter-010	For what pleasure hath it, to see in a mangled carcase what will make you shudder?
chapter-010	For what shall I say, when it is clear to me that I remember forgetfulness?
chapter-010	For when it was found, whence should she know whether it were the same, unless she remembered it?
chapter-010	For who would willingly speak thereof, if so oft as we name grief or fear, we should be compelled to be sad or fearful?
chapter-010	For with a wounded heart have I beheld Thy brightness, and stricken back I said,"Who can attain thither?
chapter-010	How can I say that the image of forgetfulness is retained by my memory, not forgetfulness itself, when I remember it?
chapter-010	How seek I it?
chapter-010	How then do I seek Thee, O Lord?
chapter-010	How then do I seek a happy life, seeing I have it not, until I can say, where I ought to say it,"It is enough"?
chapter-010	How then is it present that I remember it, since when present I can not remember?
chapter-010	I remember to have sought and found many a thing; and this I thereby know, that when I was seeking any of them, and was asked,"Is this it?"
chapter-010	If in my praise I am moved with the good of my neighbour, why am I less moved if another be unjustly dispraised than if it be myself?
chapter-010	Is it also present to itself by its image, and not by itself?
chapter-010	Is it clasped up with the eyes?
chapter-010	Is it without it, and not within?
chapter-010	Is not the life of man upon earth all trial: without any interval?
chapter-010	Is not the life of man upon earth all trial?
chapter-010	Is not this corporeal figure apparent to all whose senses are perfect?
chapter-010	Is the comparison unlike in this, because not in all respects like?
chapter-010	Is the thing different, because they are but small creatures?
chapter-010	Know I not this also?
chapter-010	Known therefore it is to all, for they with one voice be asked,"would they be happy?"
chapter-010	Notwithstanding, in how many most petty and contemptible things is our curiosity daily tempted, and how often we give way, who can recount?
chapter-010	Or, desiring to learn it as a thing unknown, either never having known, or so forgotten it, as not even to remember that I had forgotten it?
chapter-010	Shall I say that that is not in my memory, which I remember?
chapter-010	To wish, namely, to be feared and loved of men, for no other end, but that we may have a joy therein which is no joy?
chapter-010	What am I then, O my God?
chapter-010	What greater madness can be said or thought of?
chapter-010	What middle place is there betwixt these two, where the life of man is not all trial?
chapter-010	What nature am I?
chapter-010	What sayest Thou to me?
chapter-010	What shall I do then, O Thou my true life, my God?
chapter-010	What then do I confess unto Thee in this kind of temptation, O Lord?
chapter-010	What then do I love, when I love my God?
chapter-010	What third way is there?
chapter-010	What, but that I am delighted with praise, but with truth itself, more than with praise?
chapter-010	What, when I name forgetfulness, and withal recognise what I name?
chapter-010	What, when sitting at home, a lizard catching flies, or a spider entangling them rushing into her nets, oft- times takes my attention?
chapter-010	Whence and how entered these things into my memory?
chapter-010	Where in the end do we search, but in the memory itself?
chapter-010	Where is reason then, which, awake, resisteth such suggestions?
chapter-010	Where then and when did I experience my happy life, that I should remember, and love, and long for it?
chapter-010	Where then did I find Thee, that I might learn Thee, but in Thee above me?
chapter-010	Where then did I find Thee, that I might learn Thee?
chapter-010	Where then did they know this happy life, save where they know the truth also?
chapter-010	Where then?
chapter-010	Which images, how they are formed, who can tell, though it doth plainly appear by which sense each hath been brought in and stored up?
chapter-010	Who now shall search out this?
chapter-010	Who will say so?
chapter-010	Who wishes for troubles and difficulties?
chapter-010	Whom could I find to reconcile me to Thee?
chapter-010	Why am I more stung by reproach cast upon myself, than at that cast upon another, with the same injustice, before me?
chapter-010	Why seek they to hear from me what I am; who will not hear from Thee what themselves are?
chapter-010	Why then does not the disputer, thus recollecting, taste in the mouth of his musing the sweetness of joy, or the bitterness of sorrow?
chapter-010	Why then joy they not in it?
chapter-010	and to pray for me, when they shall hear how much I am held back by my own weight?
chapter-010	and who knoweth and saith,"It is false,"unless himself lieth?
chapter-010	by what prayers?
chapter-010	by what sacraments?
chapter-010	how then doth it not comprehend itself?
chapter-010	is it lulled asleep with the senses of the body?
chapter-010	is not a happy life what all will, and no one altogether wills it not?
chapter-010	of what kind it is?"
chapter-010	or is it at last that I deceive myself, and do not the truth before Thee in my heart and tongue?
chapter-010	or shall I say that forgetfulness is for this purpose in my memory, that I might not forget?
chapter-010	was I to have recourse to Angels?
chapter-010	what it is?
chapter-010	what manner of lodging hast Thou framed for Thee?
chapter-010	what manner of sanctuary hast Thou builded for Thee?
chapter-010	whence should I recognise it, did I not remember it?
chapter-010	where have they known it, that they so will it?
chapter-010	where seen it, that they so love it?
chapter-010	who ever sounded the bottom thereof?
chapter-010	who is He above the head of my soul?
chapter-010	who shall comprehend how it is?
chapter-010	why are they not happy?
chapter-010	why then speaks it not the same to all?
