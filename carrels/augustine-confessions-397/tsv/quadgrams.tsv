and the earth was	2
of men when thou	2
the valley of tears	2

and yet i measure	2
for us to thee	2
with the same confidence	2
that man of thine	2
that thou madest heaven	2
the order of thy	2
to him that made	2
had never done it	2
in the very purest	2
life of my soul	2
lighteth every man that	2
and how thou hast	2
that the dry land	2
to be made sad	2
ashamed not to be	2
one thing in the	2
the flesh lusteth against	2
to be what they	2
so as to make	2
god made the heaven	2
that in the beginning	2
he should go to	2
heart of thy servant	2
to thee is nothing	2
depth of thy counsels	2
he seemed to me	2
than as being borne	2
what did god before	2
a dispenser of thy	2
of my heart and	2
that is not yet	2
it is not there	2
we were fain to	2
the eye of flesh	2
not thine only son	2
felt that i was	2
it was no more	2
and most merciful hand	2
that thou hadst made	2
of my inmost soul	2
and it was made	2
and this could not	2
east to east again	2
thou shalt have treasure	2
on whom thou hast	2
spaces of the verses	2
as if there were	2
between water and water	2
with whom i did	2
out of those words	2
so as to become	2
the things of god	2
grow sweet unto me	2
what did it profit	2
in the books of	2
and from that moment	2
we find no time	2
for i felt that	2
and in no part	2
shall see him as	2
of thy just judgment	2
these things i then	2
the more did i	2
cry out against me	2
hear from thee of	2
from the power of	2
retained in the memory	2
with all his heart	2
and it answered me	2
to be freed of	2
meet that the knowledge	2
these things with the	2
who canst not be	2
well skilled in those	2
by the same word	2
in me what thou	2
do the heaven and	2
what should we more	2
shall i say that	2
for he would not	2
me out of all	2
the image of god	2
not yet able to	2
the eclipses of the	2
and was not ashamed	2
which thou madest was	2
and i saw that	2
where is that heaven	2
in the liberal sciences	2
so soon as she	2
in time to come	2
and no mutable thing	2
if they were asked	2
i call thee to	2
is far from me	2
to them that believe	2
come to a close	2
how long time since	2
of cold water to	2
why do ye love	2
be far from me	2
to the catholic faith	2
didst use for my	2
not belong to the	2
thy sight clear unto	2
could not speak unto	2
gathering together of the	2
i have learned in	2
when i read the	2
those which are not	2
parts of the world	2
the moving creature that	2
nor of the will	2
to have in common	2
of myself i remember	2
then is not the	2
about with every wind	2
not what time is	2

the man christ jesus	2
i knew not what	2
ye sons of men	2
that he who was	2
thou madest the heaven	2
had now begun to	2
knowledge of these things	2
and earth were to	2
in the land of	2
when i was seeking	2
is the happy life	2
for he is not	2
so soon as he	2
ye to and fro	2
that thy word was	2
when i should will	2
mercy endureth for ever	2
that through it i	2
one hour comes to	2

the cause that they	2
gave notice to the	2
the word of god	2
not what i have	2

that aught should be	2

to which i was	2

thou didst deal with	2
hast told me also	2
forgetfulness is retained by	2
there is no place	2
nor are they the	2

those things which the	2
the morning i shall	2
shall no more be	2

to repose in what	2
let it be made	2
they could not be	2
particle of thy creation	2
doubt that there was	2
for he was not	2
and the nature of	2
didst thou out of	2
i have gone over	2
i have not forgotten	2
i did not see	2
to believe god to	2
what am i to	2
that they flourished again	2
that speaketh a lie	2
a particle of thy	2
the floods of mine	2
i was grieved that	2
separated me from the	2
out of the earth	2
far be it that	2
i read not there	2
of such as are	2
lord of heaven and	2
dost thou see in	2
my god and lord	2
the work of thy	2
a young man of	2
thy mercy endureth for	2
spaces of the feet	2

had at that time	2
could not be at	2
for as he was	2
under the firmament of	2
more than the creator	2
which the lord hath	2
release from the flesh	2
it should not be	2
thou shalt light my	2
so long therefore as	2
moving creature that hath	2

that he might be	2
i shall say to	2
not my soul be	2
difference there is betwixt	2
and if nothing were	2
my desire with good	2

was on fire to	2
nor can it be	2
unto thee the sacrifice	2
no mutable thing is	2
things of a man	2
was comprehended under those	2
whatsoever state i am	2
things of this kind	2
and crown me with	2
now was the day	2
at the end of	2
to those things which	2
watered the ground under	2
remember myself to have	2
we know not whether	2
and givest grace to	2
for i could not	2
but i could not	2
the motion of the	2
know not whether out	2
out of thy law	2
my feet out of	2
the fowls that fly	2
seemed to me a	2
whether out of a	2
whence is this monstrousness	2
in that sixteenth year	2
the mouth of god	2
what we were doing	2
take up and read	2
is not so wonderful	2
over all the earth	2
into a far country	2
to be clothed upon	2
out of a pure	2
which is not yet	2
my very inmost soul	2
i could not know	2
that the knowledge of	2
have not as yet	2
and thou shalt have	2
measure the motion of	2
which we see not	2
a cup of cold	2
there was no time	2
things of this world	2
the spirit of truth	2
wallowed in the mire	2
that i was now	2
through jesus christ our	2
what is it that	2
it was that i	2
tells me in my	2
the delights of the	2
was grieved that i	2
else is it to	2
of a new life	2
the authority of the	2
i could not speak	2
matter of heaven and	2
be able to do	2
conformed to this world	2
for those first lessons	2
world was made by	2
was to be preferred	2
then do i seek	2
from the lust of	2
images of the things	2
to be sorrowed for	2
and let them say	2
who made these things	2
up in thy discipline	2
nor would i be	2
that i may find	2
can be continent unless	2
tossed up and down	2
out of that which	2
i then knew not	2
was in such wise	2
it came to pass	2
knoweth the things of	2
things to come are	2
not the image of	2
the invisible and visible	2
the same holds in	2
what could be long	2
should dawn upon me	2
for the steps of	2
or if not my	2
light that lighteth every	2
which is to be	2
i desire to know	2
let me not be	2
o ye sons of	2
deprived of all form	2
had for many years	2
sweetness of thy grace	2
let him confess unto	2
the fishes of the	2
be it that thou	2
and say unto my	2
from the love of	2
the waters brought forth	2
it could not be	2
the beasts of the	2
see him as he	2
not only our souls	2
which is in it	2
givest grace to the	2
in the chamber of	2
have treasure in heaven	2
had stuck fast in	2
but now light in	2
sight clear unto me	2
how hast thou loved	2
it shall not be	2
far be it from	2
to the firmament of	2
unless it had been	2
the sight of my	2
and therefore do i	2
who were to be	2
suffer me to speak	2
but now when i	2
not the true joy	2
because he is meek	2
of the things which	2
as it was not	2
in the heart of	2
and so it shall	2
and how far from	2
of the greater lights	2
shine upon the earth	2
me what thou teachest	2
and this is the	2
still a formless and	2
what i knew not	2
on which side is	2
in memory of the	2
the sounds are other	2
the coming of this	2
jesus christ our lord	2
thou hast made all	2
the senses of my	2
did i find thee	2
name of a disciple	2
that they are good	2
if it were said	2
the thing itself is	2
creature more than the	2
sitteth at thy right	2
what takes place in	2
in this kind of	2
of which it is	2
and the earth are	2
such as it was	2
give me what thou	2
the son of man	2
i am poor and	2
him confess unto thee	2
they daily say unto	2
to the nature of	2
dispenser of thy sacrament	2
what difference there is	2
beasts of the earth	2
which was to be	2
the one for his	2
had heard of his	2
preferable to the corruptible	2
which thou madest in	2
thou hast appointed that	2
myself to have joyed	2
god before he made	2
that which is not	2
let there be lights	2
and governor of the	2
but the earth was	2
heaven of heavens which	2
told me also with	2
is the fruit of	2
spiritual and corporeal creature	2
i am about to	2
that i should confess	2
and what was it	2
that i might learn	2
saw thy invisible things	2
is the power of	2
upon earth all trial	2
because it is truth	2
but the living soul	2
to deal with him	2
nor yet do the	2
that which i spent	2
the joy of a	2
may live unto thee	2
the several portions of	2
mother of us all	2
things out of thy	2
he was being led	2
out of a lust	2
but a particle of	2
to myself to be	2
than in the whole	2
but when it is	2
every thing that thou	2
i might learn thee	2
dare i say that	2
concupiscence of the flesh	2
let us measure it	2
that is to say	2
to see in a	2
is above our souls	2
rather there were nothing	2
and over all cattle	2
to be spoken of	2
by the senses of	2
but what sort of	2
be in a strait	2
through the senses of	2

thou hast broken my	2

whereof to make this	2
but the things themselves	2
what do i here	2
not yet such as	2
power of mine which	2
subjoined in the singular	2
did god before he	2
brought up in thy	2
less in a part	2
life of man upon	2
things which thou hast	2
and perfect will of	2
glorify him not as	2
i know how to	2
i will to be	2
in all its parts	2
but he that is	2
give what i love	2
or not much more	2
and how shall i	2
thou hast had compassion	2
the house of the	2

that it was not	2
the body which is	2
but the lord god	2
out of my heart	2
moon and stars shine	2
the rest to come	2
by which we measure	2
i have sought thy	2
so far forth it	2
not to sharpen my	2

it to be no	2
the darkness upon the	2
grace to the humble	2
fishes of the sea	2
because i would not	2
