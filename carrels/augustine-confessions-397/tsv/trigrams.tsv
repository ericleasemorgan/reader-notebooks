the words of	7
all at once	7
i have been	7
to the end	7
fountain of life	7
so far as	7
up and down	7

coeternal with thee	6
that which i	6
so great a	6
as if he	6
of the whole	6
light of the	6
thou in the	6
and the darkness	6
i confess to	6
they were not	6
if it were	6
by no means	6
it is the	6
but with the	6
of the faithful	6
it should be	6
which is called	6
it were the	6
out of that	6
was the cause	6
the kingdom of	6
the space of	6
given to the	6
thou thyself art	6
in the flesh	6
of the future	6
unto my soul	6
far from me	6
nor are they	6
that thou mayest	6
to be in	6
that i know	6
and when i	6
the thing itself	6
but when he	6
then is it	6
it could not	6
as i would	6
told me of	6
make heaven and	6
it had been	6
for no other	6
thy good spirit	6
be able to	6
by which we	6
did i not	6
what i know	6
all things are	6
the eye of	6
with a strong	6
the glory of	6
that we might	6
i do not	6
which it is	6
of this life	6
to me to	6
but the earth	6
thou wert not	6
i began to	6
or any other	6
which now is	6
of thy church	6
not my soul	6
as i was	6
spaces of times	6
such as i	6
which thou hadst	6
the catholic faith	6
the sense of	6
that god made	6
i saw not	6
for i had	6
lust of the	6
and the other	6
to whom i	6
the beginning of	6
i should be	6
the will of	6
to confess unto	6
know not how	6
but i had	6
to what end	6
let him not	6
in the name	6
as to the	6
and so it	6
when i had	6
a long time	6
in these things	6
is in the	6
shall it be	6
for there is	6
at the same	6
as a boy	6
and when they	6
but thou art	6
i did it	6
which is in	6
nor is it	6
of thy spirit	6
the joy of	6
because thou art	6
in the whole	6
the depth of	6
present of things	6
because he is	6
the other senses	6
form of the	5
of thy holy	5
then did i	5
what thou wilt	5
let us love	5
in some way	5
to be done	5
yet are they	5
the presence of	5
the ears of	5
to conceive of	5
this power of	5
that they might	5
there be three	5
me what thou	5
thou art not	5
yet was i	5
and that i	5
above the waters	5
createdst heaven and	5
had i then	5
soul of man	5
in thy presence	5
sense of the	5
as if it	5
was it not	5
and they are	5
the mother of	5
to confess to	5
but that he	5
whom thou hast	5
so long as	5
a righteous man	5
when he had	5
i had never	5
was in the	5
and in my	5
that they should	5
things of the	5
god of my	5
we may be	5
further from thee	5
and yet we	5
unless they were	5
i am thy	5
of the law	5
and in the	5
to him that	5
art the truth	5
for he is	5
was made by	5
my inner ear	5
before all times	5
and over all	5
there is a	5
unto thee the	5
is not in	5
in thy church	5
in the church	5
takes place in	5
so much the	5
i might have	5
thee to be	5
such as are	5
what i had	5
out of all	5
and yet it	5
by my own	5
for he was	5
deserve of thee	5
the land of	5
to which i	5
by the holy	5
so many years	5
unto the end	5
in this life	5
call to mind	5
wilt have mercy	5
i remember it	5
borne above the	5
do i love	5
away from the	5
by those who	5
those that are	5
given unto us	5
for a while	5
visible and invisible	5
of all these	5
ought not to	5
nor is there	5
i learnt thee	5
and in all	5
let no man	5
fruits of the	5
whether it be	5
in which i	5
that there was	5
the affections of	5
things of this	5
to be false	5
that i could	5
for i was	5
sun and moon	5
would not have	5
and by the	5
for what is	5
flesh and blood	5
thou didst not	5
is not the	5
the service of	5
the darkness of	5
of thy grace	5
so that the	5
so much as	5
an hundred years	5
there was a	5
light of my	5
much the more	5
a strong voice	5
spaces of the	5
word was made	5
what am i	5
i asked the	5
as well as	5
from the beginning	5
as i said	5
the ministry of	5
in my inner	5
what i am	5
and to be	5
for me to	5
under thy wings	5
it was that	5
did god make	5
for i am	5
also in the	5
and ye shall	5
me in my	5
in thy wisdom	5
desire to be	5
of which i	5
created heaven and	5
yet did not	5
for thou didst	5
it is a	5
that they had	5
and yet are	5
to be seen	5
be at all	5
that he would	5
go to the	5
not how to	5
is there any	5
that the earth	5
thee to have	5
to know the	5
whether he should	5
he did not	5
will pass beyond	5
lord jesus christ	5
when he was	5
thine only son	5
which is above	5
as a whole	5
as if i	5
also to be	5
a part of	5
far as i	5
the memory itself	5
it is said	5
the face of	5
what i now	5
and in this	5
the sacrifice of	5
of him that	5
nor will i	5
