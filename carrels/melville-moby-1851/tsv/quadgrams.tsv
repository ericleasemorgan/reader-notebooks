never saw such a	3

so have i seen	3
it seemed to me	3
all the things that	3
a species of the	3

shame upon all cowards	3
should like to see	3

may be said to	3
and there is a	3
it may well be	3
the will of god	3
i could not help	3
of a sperm whale	3
in the pacific ocean	3
with a view to	3
give it to him	3
bodily into the air	3
of the other boats	3
at last came to	3
cried stubb to the	3

which the right whale	3
the whole of this	3

i do not think	3
round and round in	3

all his thoughts and	2
that this harpooneer is	2
of the enormousness of	2
