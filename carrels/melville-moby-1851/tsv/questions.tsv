chapter-023	"Find who?"

chapter-128	What possesses thee to this?
chapter-005	"Broke,"said I--"broke, do you mean?"
chapter-005	"But avast,"he added, tapping his forehead,"you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer''s blanket, have ye?
chapter-005	"Ca n''t sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me?"
chapter-005	"Landlord,"I whispered,"that ai nt the harpooneer, is it?"
chapter-005	"Stop your grinning,"shouted I,"and why did n''t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?"
chapter-005	"Where is that harpooneer?
chapter-005	"Who- e debel you?"
chapter-005	"With heads to be sure; ai n''t there too many heads in the world?"
chapter-005	"With what?"
chapter-005	But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?
chapter-005	But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish?
chapter-005	But what is this on the chest?
chapter-005	Is he here?"
chapter-005	Queequeg, look here-- you sabbee me, I sabbee you-- this man sleepe you-- you sabbee?"
chapter-005	Supper?--you want supper?
chapter-005	Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight-- how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?
chapter-005	even the great leviathan himself?
chapter-005	said I,"what sort of a chap is he-- does he always keep such late hours?"
chapter-005	where''s Bulkington?"
chapter-044	Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations?
chapter-044	But how had the mystic thing been caught?
chapter-044	But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to account for it?
chapter-044	Why should this be so?
chapter-044	Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?
chapter-121	"Are they overboard?
chapter-121	"I do n''t half understand ye: what''s in the wind?"
chapter-121	"I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so?
chapter-121	"Who''s there?"
chapter-121	But do they only have mercy on long faces?--have they no bowels for a laugh?
chapter-121	The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not?
chapter-121	how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never mind how foolish?"
chapter-121	now mark his boat there; where is that stove?
chapter-121	the very course he swung to this day noon?
chapter-121	what hast thou done with her?
chapter-093	"A wooden rose- bud, eh?"
chapter-093	"Broke it?"
chapter-093	"But what are you holding yours for?"
chapter-093	"The White Whale-- a Sperm Whale-- Moby Dick, have ye seen him?"
chapter-093	"Well, then, my Bouton- de- Rose- bud, have you seen the White Whale?"
chapter-093	"What in the devil''s name do you want here?"
chapter-093	"What now?"
chapter-093	"What now?"
chapter-093	"What shall I say to him first?"
chapter-093	"What whale?"
chapter-093	"What''s the matter with your nose, there?"
chapter-093	Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye, Bouton- de- Rose?"
chapter-093	But joking aside, though; do you know, Rose- bud, that it''s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales?
chapter-093	Fine day, ai nt it?
chapter-093	are there any of you Bouton- de- Roses that speak English?"
chapter-093	keep cool-- cool?
chapter-093	yes, that''s the word; why do n''t you pack those whales in ice while you''re working at''em?
chapter-074	"Aye, aye, steward,"cried Stubb,"we''ll teach you to drug a harpooneer; none of your apothecary''s medicine here; you want to poison us, do ye?
chapter-074	"Ginger?
chapter-074	Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world?
chapter-074	But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole?
chapter-074	Do I smell ginger?"
chapter-074	Is the steward an apothecary, sir?
chapter-074	Some hot Cognac?
chapter-074	Then standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying,"Ginger?
chapter-074	What were you about saying, sir?"
chapter-074	You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?"
chapter-074	and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half- drowned man?"
chapter-074	and will you have the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough- Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger?
chapter-074	ginger?
chapter-074	is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough- boy, to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal?
chapter-115	"And I suppose thou can''st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?"
chapter-115	"And can''st thou make it all smooth, again, blacksmith, after such hard usage as it had?"
chapter-115	"Are these thy Mother Carey''s chickens, Perth?
chapter-115	"Horse- shoe stubbs, sir?
chapter-115	"What''s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?"
chapter-115	"Would''st thou brand me, Perth?"
chapter-115	Can''st thou smoothe this seam?"
chapter-115	Do the heavens yet hate thee, that thou can''st not go mad?--What wert thou making there?"
chapter-115	How can''st thou endure without being mad?
chapter-115	Is not this harpoon for the White Whale?"
chapter-115	Said I not all seams and dents but one?"
chapter-115	Thou should''st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou not go mad?
chapter-115	Will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb?"
chapter-115	wincing for a moment with the pain;"have I been but forging my own branding- iron, then?"
chapter-136	"D''ye see him?"
chapter-136	"Sir?"
chapter-136	"Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?"
chapter-136	Believe ye, men, in the things called omens?
chapter-136	D''ye feel brave men, brave?"
chapter-136	Gone?--gone?
chapter-136	Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea?
chapter-136	Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world?
chapter-136	how valiantly I seek to drive out of others''hearts what''s clinched so fast in mine!--The Parsee-- the Parsee!--gone, gone?
chapter-136	my line?
chapter-136	which way?"
chapter-135	"And did none of ye see it before?"
chapter-135	"How heading when last seen?"
chapter-135	"Lay it before me;--any missing men?"
chapter-135	"Omen?
chapter-135	"The harpoon,"said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on one bended arm--"is it safe?"
chapter-135	"What d''ye see?"
chapter-135	"What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck?
chapter-135	All ready the boats there?
chapter-135	Cold, cold-- I shiver!--How now?
chapter-135	D''ye see him?
chapter-135	D''ye see him?"
chapter-101	Ai n''t I a crow?
chapter-101	And what''s the horse- shoe sign?
chapter-101	And where''s the scare- crow?
chapter-101	But, unscrew your navel, and what''s the consequence?
chapter-101	How did it get there?
chapter-101	Now, in what sign will the sun then be?
chapter-101	Signs and wonders, eh?
chapter-101	So, what''s all this staring been about?
chapter-101	What does he say, with that look of his?
chapter-101	What says the Cannibal?
chapter-101	What then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful?
chapter-125	But how fair?
chapter-125	Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale?
chapter-125	Great God forbid!--But is there no other way?
chapter-125	Great God, where art thou?
chapter-125	Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant?
chapter-125	Loaded?
chapter-125	Shall I?
chapter-125	Sleeping?
chapter-125	What, then, remains?
chapter-125	and in these same perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error- abounding log?
chapter-125	and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear that he would have no lightning- rods?
chapter-125	hope to wrest this old man''s living power from his own living hands?
chapter-125	is he muttering in his sleep?
chapter-125	no lawful way?--Make him a prisoner to be taken home?
chapter-110	Canst thou not drive that old Adam away?
chapter-110	Carpenter?
chapter-110	In thy most solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers?
chapter-110	Is''t a riddle?
chapter-110	Look ye, pudding- heads should never grant premises.--How long before this leg is done?
chapter-110	May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?
chapter-110	Now, what''s he speaking about, and who''s he speaking to, I should like to know?
chapter-110	Shall I keep standing here?
chapter-110	Sir?
chapter-110	Sir?--Clay?
chapter-110	That''s it, hey?
chapter-110	What art thou sneezing about?
chapter-110	What art thou thrusting that thief- catcher into my face for, man?
chapter-110	What was that now about one leg standing in three places, and all three places standing in one hell-- how was that?
chapter-110	What''s Prometheus about there?--the blacksmith, I mean-- what''s he about?
chapter-110	clay, sir?
chapter-127	"And who art thou, boy?
chapter-127	"In the Isle of Man, hey?
chapter-127	"Pip?
chapter-127	"What''s that?
chapter-127	"What''s this?
chapter-127	Ha, Pip?
chapter-127	Here''s a man from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man; which is sucked in-- by what?
chapter-127	Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee?
chapter-127	Mend it, eh?
chapter-127	Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?"
chapter-127	Where wert thou born?"
chapter-127	Who art thou, boy?"
chapter-127	Who''s seen Pip the coward?"
chapter-127	come to help; eh, Pip?"
chapter-127	whom call ye Pip?
chapter-134	But do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck?
chapter-134	Is Ahab, Ahab?
chapter-134	Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this arm?
chapter-134	Sleep?
chapter-134	Sleeping?
chapter-134	Who''s to doom, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar?
chapter-134	Why this strife of the chase?
chapter-134	bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably old?
chapter-134	how the richer or better is Ahab now?
chapter-134	is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been snatched from under me?
chapter-134	who put it into him to chase and fang that flying- fish?
chapter-134	why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?
chapter-123	"Well, suppose I did?
chapter-123	And how long ago is it since you said the very contrary?
chapter-123	Do n''t you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees?
chapter-123	Do n''t you see, you timber- head, that no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless the mast is first struck?
chapter-123	I say, just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye?
chapter-123	I''ve part changed my flesh since that time, why not my mind?
chapter-123	Stop, now; did n''t you say so?"
chapter-123	These are your iron fists, hey?
chapter-123	What are you talking about, then?
chapter-123	What then?
chapter-123	Why do n''t ye be sensible, Flask?
chapter-123	it''s easy to be sensible; why do n''t ye, then?
chapter-038	"And has he a curious spout,"too, said Daggoo,"very bushy, even for a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?"
chapter-038	"And what do ye next, men?"
chapter-038	"And what tune is it ye pull to, men?"
chapter-038	"Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick-- but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg?"
chapter-038	"D''ye mark him, Flask?"
chapter-038	"Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?"
chapter-038	"Does he fan- tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?"
chapter-038	"He smites his chest,"whispered Stubb,"what''s that for?
chapter-038	"Moby Dick?"
chapter-038	"Who told thee that?"
chapter-038	And what is it?
chapter-038	Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale?
chapter-038	But what''s this long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale?
chapter-038	D''ye see it?
chapter-038	Disdain the task?
chapter-038	From this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely he will not hang back, when every foremast- hand has clutched a whetstone?
chapter-038	How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall?
chapter-038	How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab?
chapter-038	Vehemently pausing, he cried:--"What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?"
chapter-038	What is it more?
chapter-038	What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now?
chapter-038	What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using his tiara for ewer?
chapter-038	Who''s over me?
chapter-038	art not game for Moby Dick?"
chapter-038	boy, come back?
chapter-038	d''ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?"
chapter-038	know ye not the goblet end?
chapter-038	why stay ye not when ye come?
chapter-129	Art not thou the leg- maker?
chapter-129	But art thou not also the undertaker?
chapter-129	Do I sing?
chapter-129	Does it go further?
chapter-129	Dost thou never?
chapter-129	Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself?
chapter-129	Faith, sir, I''ve---- Faith?
chapter-129	Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin?
chapter-129	Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate, going in?
chapter-129	I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?
chapter-129	I was about to say, sir, that---- Art thou a silk- worm?
chapter-129	Look, did not this stump come from thy shop?
chapter-129	Sing, sir?
chapter-129	Sir?
chapter-129	The hatchway?
chapter-129	What things real are there, but imponderable thoughts?
chapter-129	What''s here?
chapter-129	What''s that?
chapter-129	Will ye never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound?
chapter-102	"And he took that arm off, did he?"
chapter-102	"Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?"
chapter-102	"But could not fasten?"
chapter-102	"Did n''t want to try to: ai n''t one limb enough?
chapter-102	"Did''st thou cross his wake again?"
chapter-102	"Hast seen the White Whale?"
chapter-102	"See you this?"
chapter-102	"Spin me the yarn,"said Ahab;"how was it?"
chapter-102	"What became of the White Whale?"
chapter-102	"What''s the matter?
chapter-102	Hast seen the White Whale?"
chapter-102	He was heading east, I think.--Is your Captain crazy?"
chapter-102	How long since thou saw''st him last?
chapter-102	What should I do without this other arm?
chapter-102	Where did''st thou see the White Whale?--how long ago?"
chapter-102	Which way heading?"
chapter-102	Which way heading?"
chapter-102	was there ever such another Bunger in the watery world?
chapter-102	why do n''t ye?
chapter-083	"Hold on, hold on, wo n''t ye?"
chapter-083	"Knife?
chapter-083	"What has he in his hand there?"
chapter-083	"Who''s got some paregoric?"
chapter-083	And when?
chapter-083	Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye?
chapter-083	Come, why do n''t some of ye burst a blood- vessel?
chapter-083	Do n''t ye love sperm?
chapter-083	Do ye love brandy?
chapter-083	Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said--"Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?
chapter-083	It''s the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before?
chapter-083	Suspended?
chapter-083	The bank of England!--Oh, do, do, do!--What''s that Yarman about now?"
chapter-083	The short and long of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?"
chapter-083	This the creature?
chapter-083	What d''ye say, Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two- and- twenty pieces for the honor of old Gay- head?
chapter-083	What d''ye say?"
chapter-083	Who had darted that stone lance?
chapter-083	and to what?
chapter-083	or his head with fish- spears?
chapter-083	this he?
chapter-018	"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?
chapter-018	"Bildad,"cried Captain Peleg,"at it again, Bildad, eh?
chapter-018	"But what takes thee a- whaling?
chapter-018	"Captain Peleg,"said I,"I have a friend with me who wants to ship too-- shall I bring him down to- morrow?"
chapter-018	"Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say-- eh?"
chapter-018	"Dost thee?"
chapter-018	"Has he ever whaled it any?"
chapter-018	"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?"
chapter-018	"Supposing it be the Captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?"
chapter-018	"Thou wast, wast thou?
chapter-018	"Want to see what whaling is, eh?
chapter-018	"Well, what dost thou think then of seeing the world?
chapter-018	"Well, what''s the report?
chapter-018	"What do ye think of him,"Bildad?
chapter-018	"What do you mean, sir?
chapter-018	"What lay does he want?"
chapter-018	"Who is Captain Ahab, sir?"
chapter-018	Ca n''t ye see the world where you stand?"
chapter-018	Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?
chapter-018	Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?"
chapter-018	How far ye got, Bildad?"
chapter-018	I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?"
chapter-018	I see thou are no Nantucketer-- ever been in a stove boat?"
chapter-018	Now then, my young man, Ishmael''s thy name, did n''t ye say?
chapter-018	Now then, thou not only wantest to go a- whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world?
chapter-018	Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale''s throat, and then jump after it?
chapter-018	Sure, ye''ve been to sea before now; sure of that?"
chapter-018	Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab?
chapter-018	Was not that what ye said?
chapter-018	Was the other one lost by a whale?"
chapter-018	When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?"
chapter-018	said Peleg when I came back; what did ye see?"
chapter-066	"And have you lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook, and do n''t know yet how to cook a whale- steak?"
chapter-066	"Come back, cook;--here, hand me those tongs;--now take that bit of steak there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be?
chapter-066	"Cook, cook!--where''s that old Fleece?"
chapter-066	"Cook,"said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth,"do n''t you think this steak is rather overdone?
chapter-066	"Cook,"said Stubb, squaring himself once more;"do you belong to the church?"
chapter-066	"Did n''t I say de Roanoke country?"
chapter-066	"Fetch him?
chapter-066	"So, then, you expect to go up into our main- top, do you, cook, when you are dead?
chapter-066	"Well then, cook; you see this whale- steak of yours was so very bad, that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that, do n''t you?
chapter-066	"Where do you expect to go to, cook?"
chapter-066	"Where were you born, cook?"
chapter-066	"Who dat?
chapter-066	And fetch him where?"
chapter-066	And yet you come here, and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?"
chapter-066	But I want to know what country you were born in, cook?"
chapter-066	But do n''t you know the higher you climb, the colder it gets?
chapter-066	D''ye hear?
chapter-066	Do n''t I always say that to be good, a whale- steak must be tough?
chapter-066	Do ye hear?
chapter-066	Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d''ye hear?
chapter-066	How old are you, cook?"
chapter-066	How you tink to hear,''spose you keep up such a dam slappin''and bitin''dare?"
chapter-066	How?
chapter-066	In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah?
chapter-066	In the first place, how old are you, cook?"
chapter-066	Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat whale?
chapter-066	Main- top, eh?"
chapter-066	Now what''s your answer?"
chapter-066	There are those sharks now over the side, do n''t you see they prefer it tough and rare?
chapter-066	You hear?
