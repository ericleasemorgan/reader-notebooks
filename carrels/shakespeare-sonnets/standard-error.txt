O! lest the world should task you to recite O! lest the world should task you to recite What merit lived in me, that you should love After my death,--dear love, forget me quite, For you in me can nothing worthy prove; Unless you would devise some virtuous lie, To do more for me than mine own desert, And hang more praise upon deceased I Than niggard truth would willingly impart: O! lest your true love may seem false in this That you for love speak well of me untrue, My name be buried where my body is, And live no more to shame nor me nor you. For I am shamed by that which I bring forth, And so should you, to love things nothing worth.

In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn, In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn, But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing; In act thy bedvow broke, and new faith torn, In vowing new hate after new love bearing: But why of two oaths ' breach do I accuse thee, When I break twenty? I am perjur'd most; For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee, And all my honest faith in thee is lost: For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness, Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy; And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness, Or made them swear against the thing they see; For I have sworn thee fair; more perjur'd I, To swear against the truth so foul a lie!

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep: Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep: A maid of Dian 's this advantage found, And his lovekindling fire did quickly steep In a cold valleyfountain of that ground; Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love, A dateless lively heat, still to endure, And grew a seeting bath, which yet men prove Against strange maladies a sovereign cure. But at my mistress' eye Love 's brand newfired, The boy for trial needs would touch my breast; I, sick withal, the help of bath desired, And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest, But found no cure, the bath for my help lies Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress ' eyes.

Why should false painting imitate his cheek, And steel dead seeming of his living hue? Why should poor beauty indirectly seek Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?

Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss, Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove: For, thou betraying me, I do betray My nobler part to my gross body 's treason; My soul doth tell my body that he may Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason, But rising at thy name doth point out thee, As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride, He is contented thy poor drudge to be, To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side. No want of conscience hold it that I call Her' love,' for whose dear love I rise and fall.

My love is as a fever longing still, My love is as a fever longing still, For that which longer nurseth the disease; Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill, The uncertain sickly appetite to please. My reason, the physician to my love, Angry that his prescriptions are not kept, Hath left me, and I desperate now approve Desire is death, which physic did except. Past cure I am, now Reason is past care, And franticmad with evermore unrest; My thoughts and my discourse as madmen 's are, At random from the truth vainly express'd; For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright, Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

No longer mourn for me when I am dead No longer mourn for me when I am dead Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell Give warning to the world that I am fled From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell: Nay, if you read this line, remember not The hand that writ it, for I love you so, That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, If thinking on me then should make you woe. O! if,--I say you look upon this verse, When I perhaps compounded am with clay, Do not so much as my poor name rehearse; But let your love even with my life decay; Lest the wise world should look into your moan, And mock you with me after I am gone.

' I hate', from hate away she threw, And sav'd my life, saying' not you'.

That god forbid, that made me first your slave, That god forbid, that made me first your slave, I should in thought control your times of pleasure, Or at your hand the account of hours to crave, Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure! O! let me suffer, being at your beck, The imprison'd absence of your liberty; And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check, Without accusing you of injury. Be where you list, your charter is so strong That you yourself may privilage your time To what you will; to you it doth belong Yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime. I am to wait, though waiting so be hell, Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.

Why with the time do I not glance aside To newfound methods, and to compounds strange? Why write I still all one, ever the same, And keep invention in a noted weed, That every word doth almost tell my name, Showing their birth, and where they did proceed? O! know sweet love I always write of you, And you and love are still my argument; So all my best is dressing old words new, Spending again what is already spent: For as the sun is daily new and old, So is my love still telling what is told.

Thy registers and thee I both defy, Not wondering at the present nor the past, For thy records and what we see doth lie, Made more or less by thy continual haste. This I do vow and this shall ever be; I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.

Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts. If I could write the beauty of your eyes, And in fresh numbers number all your graces, The age to come would say' This poet lies; Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.' So should my papers, yellow'd with their age, Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue, And your true rights beterm'd a poet 's rage And stretched metre of an antique song: But were some child of yours alive that time, You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.

Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd, Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd, Thy beauty 's form in table of my heart; My body is the frame wherein ' tis held, And perspective it is best painter 's art. For through the painter must you see his skill, To find where your true image pictur'd lies, Which in my bosom 's shop is hanging still, That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes. Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done: Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me Are windows to my breast, wherethrough the sun Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee; Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art, They draw but what they see, know not the heart.

Were it not sinful then, striving to mend, To mar the subject that before was well? For to no other pass my verses tend Than of your graces and your gifts to tell; And more, much more, than in my verse can sit, Your own glass shows you when you look in it.

No matter then although my foot did stand Upon the farthest earth remov'd from thee; For nimble thought can jump both sea and land, As soon as think the place where he would be. thought kills me that I am not thought, To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone, But that so much of earth and water wrought, I must attend time 's leisure with my moan; Receiving nought by elements so slow But heavy tears, badges of either 's woe.

Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright, How would thy shadow 's form form happy show To the clear day with thy much clearer light, When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so! How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made By looking on thee in the living day, When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay! All days are nights to see till I see thee, And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.

    summary = LVII. Being your slave what should I do but tend, Being your slave what should I do but tend, Upon the hours, and times of your desire? I have no precious time at all to spend; Nor services to do, till you require. Nor dare I chide the worldwithoutend hour, Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you, Nor think the bitterness of absence sour, When you have bid your servant once adieu; Nor dare I question with my jealous thought Where you may be, or your affairs suppose, But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought Save, where you are, how happy you make those. So true a fool is love, that in your will, Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.

O! how I faint when I of you do write, O! how I faint when I of you do write, Knowing a better spirit doth use your name, And in the praise thereof spends all his might, To make me tonguetied speaking of your fame! But since your worth-wide as the ocean is,-The humble as the proudest sail doth bear, My saucy bark, inferior far to his, On your broad main doth wilfully appear. Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat, Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride; Or, being wrack'd, I am a worthless boat, He of tall building, and of goodly pride: Then if he thrive and I be cast away, The worst was this,--my love was my decay.

    summary = XCIV. They that have power to hurt, and will do none, They that have power to hurt, and will do none, That do not do the thing they most do show, Who, moving others, are themselves as stone, Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow; They rightly do inherit heaven 's graces, And husband nature 's riches from expense; They are the lords and owners of their faces, Others, but stewards of their excellence. The summer 's flower is to the summer sweet, Though to itself, it only live and die, But if that flower with base infection meet, The basest weed outbraves his dignity: For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds; Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.

    summary: From fairest creatures we desire increase, From fairest creatures we desire increase, That thereby beauty ''s rose might never die, But as the riper should by time decease, His tender heir might bear his memory: But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes, Feed''st thy light ''s flame with selfsubstantial fuel, Making a famine where abundance lies, Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: Thou that art now the world ''s fresh ornament, And only herald to the gaudy spring, Within thine own bud buriest thy content, And tender churl mak''st waste in niggarding: Pity the world, or else this glutton be, To eat the world ''s due, by the grave and thee.

    summary: When forty winters shall besiege thy brow, When forty winters shall besiege thy brow, And dig deep trenches in thy beauty ''s field, Thy youth ''s proud livery so gazed on now, Will be a tatter''d weed of small worth held: Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies, Where all the treasure of thy lusty days; To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes, Were an alleating shame, and thriftless praise. How much more praise deserv''d thy beauty ''s use, If thou couldst answer'' This fair child of mine Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'' Proving his beauty by succession thine! This were to be new made when thou art old, And see thy blood warm when thou feel''st it cold.

Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest Now is the time that face should form another; Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother. For where is she so fair whose unear''d womb Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? Or who is he so fond will be the tomb, Of his selflove to stop posterity? Thou art thy mother ''s glass and she in thee Calls back the lovely April of her prime; So thou through windows of thine age shalt see, Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time. But if thou live, remember''d not to be, Die single and thine image dies with thee.

    summary: Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend Upon thy self thy beauty ''s legacy? Nature ''s bequest gives nothing, but doth lend, And being frank she lends to those are free: Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse The bounteous largess given thee to give? Profitless usurer, why dost thou use So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live? For having traffic with thy self alone, Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive: Then how when nature calls thee to be gone, What acceptable audit canst thou leave? Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee, Which, used, lives th'' executor to be.

    summary: Those hours, that with gentle work did frame Those hours, that with gentle work did frame The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell, Will play the tyrants to the very same And that unfair which fairly doth excel; For neverresting time leads summer on To hideous winter, and confounds him there; Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone, Beauty o''ersnowed and bareness every where: Then were not summer ''s distillation left, A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, Beauty ''s effect with beauty were bereft, Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was: But flowers distill''d, though they with winter meet, Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.

    summary: Then let not winter ''s ragged hand deface, Then let not winter ''s ragged hand deface, In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill''d: Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place With beauty ''s treasure ere it be selfkill''d. That use is not forbidden usury, Which happies those that pay the willing loan; That ''s for thy self to breed another thee, Or ten times happier, be it ten for one; Ten times thy self were happier than thou art, If ten of thine ten times refigur''d thee: Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart, Leaving thee living in posterity? Be not selfwill''d, for thou art much too fair To be death ''s conquest and make worms thine heir.

Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy: Why lov''st thou that which thou receiv''st not gladly, Or else receiv''st with pleasure thine annoy? If the true concord of welltuned sounds, By unions married, do offend thine ear, They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear. Mark how one string, sweet husband to another, Strikes each in each by mutual ordering; Resembling sire and child and happy mother, Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing: Whose speechless song being many, seeming one, Sings this to thee:'' Thou single wilt prove none.''

No love toward others in that bosom sits That on himself such murd''rous shame commits.

Spend''st thou thy fury on some worthless song, Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light? Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem, In gentle numbers time so idly spent; Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem And gives thy pen both skill and argument. Rise, resty Muse, my love ''s sweet face survey, If Time have any wrinkle graven there; If any, be a satire to decay, And make time ''s spoils despised every where. Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life, So thou prevent''st his scythe and crooked knife.

Both truth and beauty on my love depends; So dost thou too, and therein dignified. Make answer Muse: wilt thou not haply say, ''Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix''d; Beauty no pencil, beauty ''s truth to lay; But best is best, if never intermix''d''? Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb? Excuse not silence so, for''t lies in thee To make him much outlive a gilded tomb And to be prais''d of ages yet to be. Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how To make him seem long hence as he shows now.

My love is strengthen''d, though more weak in seeming; My love is strengthen''d, though more weak in seeming; I love not less, though less the show appear; That love is merchandiz''d, whose rich esteeming, The owner ''s tongue doth publish every where. Our love was new, and then but in the spring, When I was wo nt to greet it with my lays; As Philomel in summer ''s front doth sing, And stops her pipe in growth of riper days: Not that the summer is less pleasant now Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night, But that wild music burthens every bough, And sweets grown common lose their dear delight. Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue: Because I would not dull you with my song.

Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth, what poverty my Muse brings forth, That having such a scope to show her pride, The argument, all bare, is of more worth Than when it hath my added praise beside! O! blame me not, if I no more can write! Look in your glass, and there appears a face That overgoes my blunt invention quite, Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace. Were it not sinful then, striving to mend, To mar the subject that before was well? For to no other pass my verses tend Than of your graces and your gifts to tell; And more, much more, than in my verse can sit, Your own glass shows you when you look in it.

Three winters cold, Have from the forests shook three summers '' pride, Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn''d, In process of the seasons have I seen, Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn''d, Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green. yet doth beauty like a dialhand, Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv''d; So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand, Hath motion, and mine eye may bedeceiv''d: For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred: Ere you were born was beauty ''s summer dead.

    summary: Let not my love be call''d idolatry, Let not my love be call''d idolatry, Nor my beloved as an idol show, Since all alike my songs and praises be Kind is my love today, tomorrow kind, Still constant in a wondrous excellence; Therefore my verse to constancy confin''d, One thing expressing, leaves out difference. ''Fair, kind, and true,'' is all my argument, ''Fair, kind, and true,'' varying to other words; And in this change is my invention spent, Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords. Fair, kind, and true, have often liv''d alone, Which three till now, never kept seat in one.

    summary: CVI. When in the chronicle of wasted time When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions of the fairest wights, And beauty making beautiful old rime, In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights, Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty ''s best, Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow, I see their antique pen would have express''d Even such a beauty as you master now. So all their praises are but prophecies Of this our time, all you prefiguring; And for they looked but with divining eyes, They had not skill enough your worth to sing: For we, which now behold these present days, Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.

What ''s new to speak, what now to register, That may express my love, or thy dear merit? Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine, I must each day say o''er the very same; Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine, Even as when first I hallow''d thy fair name. So that eternal love in love ''s fresh case, Weighs not the dust and injury of age, Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place, But makes antiquity for aye his page; Finding the first conceit of love there bred, Where time and outward form would show it dead.

Never believe though in my nature reign''d, All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood, That it could so preposterously be stain''d, To leave for nothing all thy sum of good; For nothing this wide universe I call, Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.

    summary: CXXXI. Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art, Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art, As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel; For well thou know''st to my dear doting heart Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel. Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold, Thy face hath not the power to make love groan; To say they err I dare not be so bold, Although I swear it to myself alone. And to be sure that is not false I swear, A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face, One on another ''s neck, do witness bear Thy black is fairest in my judgment ''s place. In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds, And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.

Then will I swear beauty herself is black, And all they foul that thy complexion lack.

    summary: CLIV. The little Love-god lying once asleep The little Lovegod lying once asleep, Laid by his side his heartinflaming brand, Whilst many nymphs that vow''d chaste life to keep Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand The fairest votary took up that fire Which many legions of true hearts had warm''d; And so the general of hot desire Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm''d. This brand she quenched in a cool well by, Which from Love ''s fire took heat perpetual, Growing a bath and healthful remedy, For men diseas''d; but I, my mistress'' thrall, Came there for cure and this by that I prove, Love ''s fire heats water, water cools not love.

    summary: Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all; Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all; What hast thou then more than thou hadst before? No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call; All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more. Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest, I can not blame thee, for my love thou usest; But yet be blam''d, if thou thy self deceivest By wilful taste of what thyself refusest. I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief, Although thou steal thee all my poverty: And yet, love knows it is a greater grief To bear love ''s wrong, than hate ''s known injury. Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows, Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.

Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits, Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits, When I am sometime absent from thy heart, Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits, For still temptation follows where thou art. Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won, Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail''d; And when a woman woos, what woman ''s son Will sourly leave her till he have prevail''d? but yet thou mightst my seat forbear, And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth, Who lead thee in their riot even there Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:-Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee, Thine by thy beauty being false to me.

That thou hast her it is not all my grief, That thou hast her it is not all my grief, And yet it may be said I loved her dearly; That she hath thee is of my wailing chief, A loss in love that touches me more nearly. Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye: Thou dost love her, because thou know''st I love her; And for my sake even so doth she abuse me, Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her. If I lose thee, my loss is my love ''s gain, And losing her, my friend hath found that loss; Both find each other, and I lose both twain, And both for my sake lay on me this cross: But here ''s the joy; my friend and I are one; Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.

Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright, How would thy shadow ''s form form happy show To the clear day with thy much clearer light, When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so! How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made By looking on thee in the living day, When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay! All days are nights to see till I see thee, And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.

    summary: LXVI. Tired with all these, for restful death I cry, Tired with all these, for restful death I cry, As to behold desert a beggar born, And needy nothing trimm''d in jollity, And purest faith unhappily forsworn, And gilded honour shamefully misplac''d, And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted, And right perfection wrongfully disgrac''d, And strength by limping sway disabled And art made tonguetied by authority, And folly-doctorlike-controlling skill, And simple truth miscall''d simplicity, And captive good attending captain ill: Tir''d with all these, from these would I be gone, Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.

Why should false painting imitate his cheek, And steel dead seeming of his living hue? Why should poor beauty indirectly seek Roses of shadow, since his rose is true? Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is, Beggar''d of blood to blush through lively veins? For she hath no exchequer now but his, And proud of many, lives upon his gains. O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had In days long since, before these last so bad.

Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn, Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn, When beauty lived and died as flowers do now, Before these bastard signs of fair were born, Or durst inhabit on a living brow; Before the golden tresses of the dead, The right of sepulchres, were shorn away, To live a second life on second head; Ere beauty ''s dead fleece made another gay: In him those holy antique hours are seen, Without all ornament, itself and true, Making no summer of another ''s green, Robbing no old to dress his beauty new; And him as for a map doth Nature store, To show false Art what beauty was of yore.

Those parts of thee that the world ''s eye doth view Those parts of thee that the world ''s eye doth view Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend; All tongues-the voice of souls-give thee that due, Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend. Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown''d; But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own, In other accents do this praise confound By seeing farther than the eye hath shown. They look into the beauty of thy mind, And that in guess they measure by thy deeds; Then-churls-their thoughts, although their eyes were kind, To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds: But why thy odour matcheth not thy show, The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.

O! what a happy title do I find, Happy to have thy love, happy to die! But what ''s so blessedfair that fears no blot? Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.

    summary: XCIII. So shall I live, supposing thou art true, So shall I live, supposing thou art true, Like a deceived husband; so love ''s face May still seem love to me, though alter''d new; Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place: For there can live no hatred in thine eye, Therefore in that I can not know thy change. In many ''s looks, the false heart ''s history Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange. But heaven in thy creation did decree That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell; Whate''er thy thoughts, or thy heart ''s workings be, Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell. How like Eve ''s apple doth thy beauty grow, If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!

    summary: XCIV. They that have power to hurt, and will do none, They that have power to hurt, and will do none, That do not do the thing they most do show, Who, moving others, are themselves as stone, Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow; They rightly do inherit heaven ''s graces, And husband nature ''s riches from expense; They are the lords and owners of their faces, Others, but stewards of their excellence. The summer ''s flower is to the summer sweet, Though to itself, it only live and die, But if that flower with base infection meet, The basest weed outbraves his dignity: For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds; Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.

    summary: XCV. How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose, Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name! O! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose. That tongue that tells the story of thy days, Making lascivious comments on thy sport, Can not dispraise, but in a kind of praise; Naming thy name, blesses an ill report. O! what a mansion have those vices got Which for their habitation chose out thee, Where beauty ''s veil doth cover every blot And all things turns to fair that eyes can see! Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege; The hardest knife illus''d doth lose his edge.

    summary: XCVI. Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness; Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness; Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport; Both grace and faults are lov''d of more and less: Thou mak''st faults graces that to thee resort. As on the finger of a throned queen The basest jewel will be well esteem''d, So are those errors that in thee are seen To truths translated, and for true things deem''d. How many lambs might the stern wolf betray, If like a lamb he could his looks translate! How many gazers mightst thou lead away, if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state! But do not so; I love thee in such sort, As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

    summary: XCVII. How like a winter hath my absence been How like a winter hath my absence been From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year! What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen! What old December ''s bareness everywhere! And yet this time removed was summer ''s time; The teeming autumn, big with rich increase, Bearing the wanton burden of the prime, Like widow''d wombs after their lords '' decease: Yet this abundant issue seem''d to me But hope of orphans, and unfather''d fruit; For summer and his pleasures wait on thee, And, thou away, the very birds are mute: Or, if they sing,'' tis with so dull a cheer, That leaves look pale, dreading the winter ''s near.

    summary: XCIX. The forward violet thus did I chide: The forward violet thus did I chide: Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells, If not from my love ''s breath? The purple pride Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells In my love ''s veins thou hast too grossly dy''d. The lily I condemned for thy hand, And buds of marjoram had stol''n thy hair; The roses fearfully on thorns did stand, One blushing shame, another white despair; A third, nor red nor white, had stol''n of both, And to his robbery hadannex''d thy breath; But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth A vengeful canker eat him up to death. More flowers I noted, yet I none could see, But sweet, or colour it had stol''n from thee.
