To me, fair friend, you never can be old, To me, fair friend, you never can be old, For as you were when first your eye I ey'd, Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold, Have from the forests shook three summers ' pride, Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd, In process of the seasons have I seen, Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd, Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green. yet doth beauty like a dialhand, Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd; So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand, Hath motion, and mine eye may bedeceiv'd: For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred: Ere you were born was beauty 's summer dead.	./cache/shakespeare-sonnets_104.txt	./txt/shakespeare-sonnets_104.txt
