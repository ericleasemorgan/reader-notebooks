Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press My tonguetied patience with too much disdain; Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express The manner of my pitywanting pain. If I might teach thee wit, better it were, Though not to love, yet, love to tell me so;-As testy sick men, when their deaths be near, No news but health from their physicians know;-For, if I should despair, I should grow mad, And in my madness might speak ill of thee; Now this illwresting world is grown so bad, Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be. That I may not be so, nor thou belied, Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.	./cache/shakespeare-sonnets_140.txt	./txt/shakespeare-sonnets_140.txt
