Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits, Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits, When I am sometime absent from thy heart, Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits, For still temptation follows where thou art. Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won, Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail'd; And when a woman woos, what woman 's son Will sourly leave her till he have prevail'd? but yet thou mightst my seat forbear, And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth, Who lead thee in their riot even there Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:-Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee, Thine by thy beauty being false to me.	./cache/shakespeare-sonnets_41.txt	./txt/shakespeare-sonnets_41.txt
