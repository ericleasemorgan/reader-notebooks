What is your substance, whereof are you made, What is your substance, whereof are you made, That millions of strange shadows on you tend? Since every one, hath every one, one shade, And you but one, can every shadow lend.

In all external grace you have some part, But you like none, none you, for constant heart.	./cache/shakespeare-sonnets_53.txt	./txt/shakespeare-sonnets_53.txt
