That thou hast her it is not all my grief, That thou hast her it is not all my grief, And yet it may be said I loved her dearly; That she hath thee is of my wailing chief, A loss in love that touches me more nearly. Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye: Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her; And for my sake even so doth she abuse me, Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her. If I lose thee, my loss is my love 's gain, And losing her, my friend hath found that loss; Both find each other, and I lose both twain, And both for my sake lay on me this cross: But here 's the joy; my friend and I are one; Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.	./cache/shakespeare-sonnets_42.txt	./txt/shakespeare-sonnets_42.txt
