Two loves I have of comfort and despair, Two loves I have of comfort and despair, Which like two spirits do suggest me still: The better angel is a man right fair, The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill. To win me soon to hell, my female evil, Tempteth my better angel from my side, And would corrupt my saint to be a devil, Wooing his purity with her foul pride. And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend, Suspect I may, yet not directly tell; But being both from me, both to each friend, I guess one angel in another 's hell: Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt, Till my bad angel fire my good one out.	./cache/shakespeare-sonnets_144.txt	./txt/shakespeare-sonnets_144.txt
