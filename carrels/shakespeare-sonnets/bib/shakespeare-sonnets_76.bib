Why is my verse so barren of new pride, Why is my verse so barren of new pride, So far from variation or quick change? Why with the time do I not glance aside To newfound methods, and to compounds strange? Why write I still all one, ever the same, And keep invention in a noted weed, That every word doth almost tell my name, Showing their birth, and where they did proceed? O! know sweet love I always write of you, And you and love are still my argument; So all my best is dressing old words new, Spending again what is already spent: For as the sun is daily new and old, So is my love still telling what is told.	./cache/shakespeare-sonnets_76.txt	./txt/shakespeare-sonnets_76.txt
