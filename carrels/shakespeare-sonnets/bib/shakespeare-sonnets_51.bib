Till I return, of posting is no need. O! what excuse will my poor beast then find, When swift extremity can seem but slow? Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind, In winged speed no motion shall I know, Then can no horse with my desire keep pace; Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made, Shall neigh-no dull flesh-in his fiery race; But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,-' Since from thee going, he went wilfulslow, Towards thee I 'll run, and give him leave to go.'	./cache/shakespeare-sonnets_51.txt	./txt/shakespeare-sonnets_51.txt
