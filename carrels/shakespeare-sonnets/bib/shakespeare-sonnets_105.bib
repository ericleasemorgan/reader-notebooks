'Fair, kind, and true,' is all my argument, 'Fair, kind, and true,' varying to other words; And in this change is my invention spent, Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords. Fair, kind, and true, have often liv'd alone, Which three till now, never kept seat in one.	./cache/shakespeare-sonnets_105.txt	./txt/shakespeare-sonnets_105.txt
