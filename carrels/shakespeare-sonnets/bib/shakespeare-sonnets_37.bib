As a decrepit father takes delight As a decrepit father takes delight To see his active child do deeds of youth, So I, made lame by Fortune 's dearest spite, Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth; For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit, Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit, I make my love engrafted, to this store: So then I am not lame, poor, nor despis'd, Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give That I in thy abundance am suffic'd, And by a part of all thy glory live. Look what is best, that best I wish in thee: This wish I have; then ten times happy me!	./cache/shakespeare-sonnets_37.txt	./txt/shakespeare-sonnets_37.txt
