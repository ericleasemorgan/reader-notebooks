Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you, Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you, Drink up the monarch 's plague, this flattery? Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true, And that your love taught it this alchemy, To make of monsters and things indigest Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble, Creating every bad a perfect best, As fast as objects to his beams assemble? O!' tis the first,' tis flattery in my seeing, And my great mind most kingly drinks it up: Mineeye well knows what with his gust is' greeing, And to his palate doth prepare the cup: If it be poison'd,' tis the lesser sin That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.	./cache/shakespeare-sonnets_114.txt	./txt/shakespeare-sonnets_114.txt
