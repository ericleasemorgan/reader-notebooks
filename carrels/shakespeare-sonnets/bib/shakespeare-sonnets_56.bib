Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said Thy edge should blunter be than appetite, Which but today by feeding is allay'd, Tomorrow sharpened in his former might: So, love, be thou, although today thou fill Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness, Tomorrow see again, and do not kill The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.
