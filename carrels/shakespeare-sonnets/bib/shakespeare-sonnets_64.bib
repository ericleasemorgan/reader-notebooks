When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd When I have seen by Time 's fell handdefac'd The richproud cost of outworn buried age; When sometime lofty towers I see downraz'd, And brass eternal slave to mortal rage; When I have seen the hungry ocean gain Advantage on the kingdom of the shore, And the firm soil win of the watery main, Increasing store with loss, and loss with store; When I have seen such interchange of state, Or state itself confounded, to decay; Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate-That Time will come and take my love away. This thought is as a death which can not choose But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.	./cache/shakespeare-sonnets_64.txt	./txt/shakespeare-sonnets_64.txt
