And Achilles answered," Fear not, but speak as it is borne in upon you from heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to whom you pray, and whose oracles you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his hand upon you, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth— no, not though you name Agamemnon himself, who is by far the foremost of the Achaeans."

But Juno said to Minerva," Alas, daughter of aegisbearing Jove, unweariable, shall the Argives fly home to their own land over the broad sea, and leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes? Those who held the strong city of Mycenae, rich Corinth and Cleonae; Orneae, Araethyrea, and Licyon, where Adrastus reigned of old; Hyperesia, high Gonoessa, and Pellene; Aegium and all the coastland round about Helice; these sent a hundred ships under the command of King Agamemnon, son of Atreus.

Hear from my mouth," said he," Trojans and Achaeans, the saying of Alexandrus, through whom this quarrel has come about. He bids the Trojans and Achaeans lay their armour upon the ground, while he and Menelaus fight in the midst of you for Helen and all her wealth. He went up to Priam and said," Son of Laomedon, the princes of the Trojans and Achaeans bid you come down on to the plain and swear to a solemn covenant. Then Priam, descendant of Dardanus, spoke, saying," Hear me, Trojans and Achaeans, I will now go back to the windbeaten city of Ilius: I dare not with my own eyes witness this fight between my son and Menelaus, for Jove and the other immortals alone know which shall fall."

Menelaus," said he," has two good friends among the goddesses, Juno of Argos, and Minerva of Alalcomene, but they only sit still and look on, while Venus keeps ever by Alexandrus '' side to defend him in any danger ;indeed she has just rescued him when he made sure that it was all over with him— for the victory really did lie with Menelaus. Tell Minerva to go and take part in the fight at once, and let her contrive that the Trojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the Achaeans." Presently he found standing amid the brave warriors who had followed him from Tricca; thereon he went up to him and said," Son of Aesculapius, King Agamemnon says you are to come and see Menelaus immediately.

Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall, but Phoebus Apollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of darkness, lest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him; and Diomed shouted out as he left her," Daughter of Jove, leave war and battle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling silly women?

Apollo, son of Jove, replied," Let us incite great Hector to challenge some one of the Danaans in single combat; on this the Achaeans will be shamed into finding a man who will fight him." He found the Danaans, servants of Mars, in council at the stern of Agamemnon ''s ship, and took his place in the midst of them." Son of Atreus," he said," and princes of the Achaean host, Priam and the other noble Trojans have sent me to tell you the saying of Alexandrus through whom this quarrel has come about, if so be that you may find it acceptable.

Hector was greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but let him lie for all his sorrow, while he went in quest of another driver; nor did his steeds have to go long without one, for he presently found brave Archeptolemus the son of Iphitus, and made him get up behind the horses, giving the reins into his hand.

They all held their peace, dismayed at the sternness with which he had denied them, till presently the old knight Phoenix in his great fear for the ships of the Achaeans, burst into tears and said," Noble Achilles, if you are now minded to return, and in the fierceness of your anger will do nothing to save the ships from burning, how, my son, can I remain here without you?

The two Ajaxes, servants of Mars, Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to go, so did Menelaus son of Atreus; Ulysses also wished to go among the host of the Trojans, for he was ever full of daring, and thereon Agamemnon king of men spoke thus:" Diomed," said he," son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, choose your comrade for yourself— take the best man of those that have offered, for many would now go with you.

Then she said," Hector son of Priam, peer of gods in counsel, father Jove has sent me to bear you this message— so long as you see Agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks, you are to keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle, but when Agamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes to his chariot, then will Jove vouchsafe you strength to slay till you reach the ships, and till night falls at the going down of the sun."

homer-iliad_14		homer-iliad_14		5256	165		74	./cache/homer-iliad_14.txt	./txt/homer-iliad_14.txt	The Trojans are fighting stubbornly and without ceasing at the ships; look where you may you can not see from what quarter the rout of the Achaeans is coming; they are being killed in a confused mass and the battlecry ascends to heaven; let us think, if counsel can be of any use, what we had better do; but I do not advise our going into battle ourselves, for a man can not fight when he is wounded." And King Agamemnon answered," Nestor, if the Trojans are indeed fighting at the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the trench has served us— over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and which they deemed would be an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet —I see it must be the will of Jove that the Achaeans should perish ingloriously here, far from Argos.

If, then, you are speaking the truth and mean what you say, go among the rank and file of the gods, and tell Iris and Apollo lord of the bow, that I want them— Iris, that she may go to the Achaean host and tell Neptune to leave off fighting and go home, and Apollo, that he may send Hector again into battle and give him fresh strength; he will thus forget his present sufferings, and drive the Achaeans back in confusion till they fall among the ships of Achilles son of Peleus.

Even as fierce ravening wolves that are feasting upon a homed stag which they have killed upon the mountains, and their jaws are red with blood— they go in a pack to lap water from the clear spring with their long thin tongues; and they reek of blood and slaughter ;they know not what fear is, for it is hunger drives them— even so did the leaders and counsellors of the Myrmidons gather round the good squire of the fleet descendant of Aeacus, and among them stood Achilles himself cheering on both men and horses.

Then Ulysses said," Achilles, godlike and brave, send not the Achaeans thus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for the battle will be no brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has filled both sides with fury; bid them first take food both bread and wine by the ships, for in this there is strength and stay.

She called the gods about her, and said," Look to it, you two, Neptune and Minerva, and consider how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has been sending Aeneas clad in full armour to fight Achilles. "Be not afraid, proud Trojans," said he," to face the son of Peleus; I could fight gods myself if the battle were one of words only, but they would be more than a match for me, if we had to use our spears.

As when fish fly scared before a huge dolphin, and fill every nook and corner of some fair haven— for he is sure to eat all he can catch— even so did the Trojans cower under the banks of the mighty river, and when Achilles '' arms grew weary with killing them, he drew twelve youths alive out of the water, to sacrifice in revenge for Patroclus son of Menoetius.

Then Minerva said," Dear brother, my father and mother went down on their knees and implored me, as did all my comrades, to remain inside, so great a fear has fallen upon them all; but I was in an agony of grief when I beheld you; now, therefore, let us two make a stand and fight, and let there be no keeping our spears in reserve, that we may learn whether Achilles shall kill us and bear off our spoils to the ships, or whether he shall fall before you."

Thus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his saying, and were for doing as he had said, but Nestor ''s son Antilochus stood up and claimed his rights from the son of Peleus." Achilles," said he," I shall take it much amiss if you do this thing; you would rob me of my prize, because you think Eumelus ''s chariot and horses were thrown out, and himself too, good man that he is.

When he heard this the old man ''s heart failed him, and he was in great fear; he stayed where he was as one dazed, and the hair stood on end over his whole body; but the bringer of good luck came up to him and took him by the hand, saying," Whither, father, are you thus driving your mules and horses in the dead of night when other men are asleep?

In the meantime I will go to Ithaca, to put heart into Ulysses '' son Telemachus; I will embolden him to call the Achaeans in assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his mother Penelope, who persist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; I will also conduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if he can hear anything about the return of his dear father— for this will make people speak well of him."

Sweet hearts,'' said she,'' Ulysses is indeed dead, still do not press me to marry again immediately, wait— for I would not have skill in needlework perish unrecorded— till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes, to be in readiness against the time when death shall take him. The suitors, therefore, make you this answer, that both you and the Achaeans may understand—''Send your mother away, and bid her marry the man of her own and of her father ''s choice''; for I do not know what will happen if she goes on plaguing us much longer with the airs she gives herself on the score of the accomplishments Minerva has taught her, and because she is so clever.

"When, however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting sail in our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit to vex the Argives on their homeward voyage; for they had not all been either wise or understanding, and hence many came to a bad end through the displeasure of Jove ''s daughter Minerva, who brought about a quarrel between the two sons of Atreus. Then Minerva answered," Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be much better that Telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore, shall return with you and sleep at your house, but I must go back to give orders to my crew, and keep them in good heart.

Presently, when I had had my fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man of the sea said,'' Son of Atreus, do not waste any more time in crying so bitterly; it can do no manner of good; find your way home as fast as ever you can, for Aegisthus may be still alive, and even though Orestes has been beforehand with you in killing him, you may yet come in for his funeral.''

He could see him sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged his head and muttered to himself, saying," Good heavens, so the gods have been changing their minds about Ulysses while I was away in Ethiopia, and now he is close to the land of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed that he shall escape from the calamities that have befallen him. Ulysses '' heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to himself," Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that I had given up all hope, but I can find no landing place, for the coast is rocky and surfbeaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the sea, with deep water close under them so that I can not climb out for want of foot hold.

Then when they had made their drink offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode, leaving Ulysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the servants were taking the things away after supper.

Look here my friends,'' said I,'' we are not going to die so much before our time after all, and at any rate we will not starve so long as we have got something to eat and drink on board.'' On this they uncovered their heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag, for he was indeed a splendid fellow. They knew me at once, seized me each of them by the hand, and wept for joy till the whole house was filled with the sound of their halloaballooing, and Circe herself was so sorry for them that she came up to me and said,'' Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, go back at once to the sea where you have left your ship, and first draw it on to the land.

He knew me and said,'' Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, why, poor man, have you left the light of day and come down to visit the dead in this sad place? "''This,'' I answered,'' must be as it may please heaven, but tell me and tell me and tell me true, I see my poor mother ''s ghost close by us; she is sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though I am her own son she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me, Sir, how I can make her know me.''

"Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we had been killing his cows, whereon he flew into a great rage, and said to the immortals,'' Father Jove, and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss, I must have vengeance on the crew of Ulysses '' ship: they have had the insolence to kill my cows, which were the one thing I loved to look upon, whether I was going up heaven or down again. The men all fell into the sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship, looking like so many seagulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of getting home again.

Eumaeus answered," Old man, no traveller who comes here with news will get Ulysses '' wife and son to believe his story. To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus," Old man, you will neither get paid for bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home; drink your wine in peace, and let us talk about something else.

Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus and Pisistratus yoked the horses, and took their places in the chariot.

Then they laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus said to Eumaeus," Old friend, where does this stranger come from? Or if you like you can keep him here at the station, and I will send him clothes and food that he may be no burden on you and on your men; but I will not have him go near the suitors, for they are very insolent, and are sure to ill treat him in a way that would greatly grieve me; no matter how valiant a man may be he can do nothing against numbers, for they will be too strong for him."

This was what Menelaus told me, and when I had heard his story I came away; the gods then gave me a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again." Telemachus took a whole loaf from the breadbasket, with as much meat as he could hold in his two hands, and said to Eumaeus," Take this to the stranger, and tell him to go the round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must not be shamefaced."

Eurymachus then came up and said," Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos could see you at this moment, you would have still more suitors in your house by tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman in the whole world both as regards personal beauty and strength of understanding." But Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their insolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become even more bitter against them; she therefore set Eurymachus son of Polybus on to gibe at him, which made the others laugh.

As she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting to tell her that her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was unable to look in that direction and observe what was going on, for Minerva had diverted her attention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea by the throat with his right hand and with his left drew her close to him, and said," Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who nursed me at your own breast, now that after twenty years of wandering I am at last come to my own home again?

He girded his sword about his shoulder, bound his sandals on to his comely feet, and took a doughty spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the threshold of the cloister and said to Euryclea," Nurse, did you make the stranger comfortable both as regards bed and board, or did you let him shift for himself?—for my mother, good woman though she is, has a way of paying great attention to secondrate people, and of neglecting others who are in reality much better men."

He was now the first to take the bow and arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he could not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard work, they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors," My friends, I can not string it; let another have it, this bow shall take the life and soul out of many a chief among us, for it is better to die than to live after having missed the prize that we have so long striven for, and which has brought us so long together.

Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been shooting the suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another :when his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end wall of the house by the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of horsehair that nodded menacingly above it and he grasped two redoubtable bronzeshod spears.

" First wash and put your shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their own room and dress; Phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre, so that if people outside hear, or any of the neighbours, or some one going along the street happens to notice it, they may think there is a wedding in the house, and no rumours about the death of the suitors will get about in the town, before we can escape to the woods upon my own land.

And the ghost of Amphimedon answered," Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king of men, I remember everything that you have said, and will tell you fully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought about. She set up a great tambour frame in her room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework.'' Sweethearts,'' said she,'' Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry again immediately ;wait— for I would not have my skill in needlework perish unrecorded— till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes, against the time when death shall take him.
