Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been shooting the suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another :when his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end wall of the house by the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of horsehair that nodded menacingly above it and he grasped two redoubtable bronzeshod spears.	./cache/homer-odyssey_22.txt	./txt/homer-odyssey_22.txt
