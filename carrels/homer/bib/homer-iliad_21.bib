As when fish fly scared before a huge dolphin, and fill every nook and corner of some fair haven— for he is sure to eat all he can catch— even so did the Trojans cower under the banks of the mighty river, and when Achilles ' arms grew weary with killing them, he drew twelve youths alive out of the water, to sacrifice in revenge for Patroclus son of Menoetius.	./cache/homer-iliad_21.txt	./txt/homer-iliad_21.txt
