And Achilles answered," Fear not, but speak as it is borne in upon you from heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to whom you pray, and whose oracles you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his hand upon you, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earthâ€” no, not though you name Agamemnon himself, who is by far the foremost of the Achaeans."	./cache/homer-iliad_01.txt	./txt/homer-iliad_01.txt
