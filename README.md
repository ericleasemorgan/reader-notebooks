Distant Reader Notebooks
========================

This repository includes a set of Jupyter Notebooks and sample data intended to instruct students, researchers, and scholars on the use of text mining & natural language processing techniques against Distant Reader output -- affectionately called "study carrels".

What is the Distant Reader, and why should I care?
--------------------------------------------------

The Distant Reader is a tool for reading.

With the advent of the Internet people feel as if they are "drinking from a firehose" -- ofttimes called "information overload". The Distant Reader is a tool enabling students, researchers, or scholars to embrace information overload, identify patterns & trends in the things they read, and ultimately use & understand their readings more thoroughly. In this way, The Distant Reader is not a replacement for the traditional reading process. Instead, the Distant Reader is intended to supplement traditional reading.


What are "study carrels"?
-------------------------

Study carrels are the names given to the outputs of the Distant Reader process. They are structured data sets lending themselves to analysis ("reading") by people or computers. 

Given an almost arbitrary amount of unstructured data (think "text") as input, the Distant Reader outputs a set of structured data -- a study carrel.
