Introduction
------------

With the advent of the Internet people feel as if they are "drinking from a firehose" -- ofttimes called "information overload". The Distant Reader enables students, researchers, or scholars to embrace information overload, identify patterns & trends in the things they read, and ultimately use & understand their readings more thoroughly. The Distant Reader is not a replacement for traditional reading. No, instead, the Distant Reader supplements the traditional reading process.
